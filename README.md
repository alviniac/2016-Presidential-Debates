# 2016 Presidential Debates

The goal of this mini-project will be to scrape data in the form of transcripts of presidential debates and to conduct text analysis. My inspiration for this project came to be when I found out that Trump said something along the lines of "I use better words than Hillary". I want to assess the validity of this statement by analyzing both Hillary and Trump's speech in their debates. While I'm at it, I will also create a wordcloud for each speech to see what words each candidate used most in their speeches (just because I've always wanted to make one).

I'd like to answer the following questions:
  1. Did Trump use "better words" than Hillary in the debate?
      - One way to see who uses "better words" is to look at each candidate's vocabulary range. We can count the number of unique words             used versus the total number of words.
  2. What words did each candidate use most?
      - This gives us a good idea of what the candidates talked about most. We can create a word cloud for this.
